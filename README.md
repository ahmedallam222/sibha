# A progress bar that keeps track of the total number of beads, the daily number of beads, the weekly number of beads, and the monthly number of beads
  # A button to reset the progress
  # A candle illustration
   # JavaScript code that increases the current bead count when the center bead is clicked and updates the progress bar
  #  The code also keeps track of the current day, week, and month and resets the daily, weekly, and monthly bead counts accordingly
 #   The code also uses local storage to save the current bead count, daily bead count, weekly bead count, and monthly bead count so that the progress can be resumed later
 #   The code also adds and removes the 'active' class from the center bead and updates its innerHTML to reflect the current bead count
  #  The code also has a function called activateBead that updates the progress bar and sets the center bead to the current bead count.
